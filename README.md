# Personal Portfolio Website

## Titus Lee's personal, professional portfolio website coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project is my personal, professional portfolio website. This website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The server is hosted through GitHub, and the domain is registered and bought through Namecheap. The website is designed to display my resume, projects, contact information, and information about me.

  * All the images and links within the website are provided within this GitHub webpage.
  * The main running file is the index.html file, which is directly linked with the style.css file. The JavaScript programming code is implemented within the HTML code without creating a separate file.
  * At the bottom of the style.css file, there is a separate section of CSS code written distinctively for the website layout on mobile devices (devices with a screen width of less than 600 pixels).
  * The HTML code itself contains a third portfolio project section that is currently set to be hidden within the website since the project is still under work and will be shown with a hyperlink to the code once the project is finished.
  * DISCLAIMER - Honestly, I just put all of my personal information out there since I didn't know how else I would make a website private and only be shown to a select few, but just please don't steal or do anything with my personal infomration. Thank you :)
